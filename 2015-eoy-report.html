      <h4>A word from our cofounders</h4>
      
      <p class="byline">By <a href="https://www.minnpost.com/author/joel-kramer">Joel</a> and <a href="https://www.minnpost.com/author/laurie-kramer">Laurie</a> Kramer</p>
      
      <p>MinnPost is bigger and better than ever.&nbsp; In our eighth year, we set new highs for readership and membership, and for the second year in a row we were named by the Online News Association as one of the top sites in the nation for enterprises with fewer than 50 staff members.&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p>A year ago, we reported that we had begun positioning ourselves for a successful future, hiring two new leaders for the editorial and business sides of MinnPost.&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p>In this Year End Report, you will hear from those new leaders about what their teams have accomplished, with your help.&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p>The two Andys – publisher Andrew Wallmeyer and executive editor Andrew Putz – have now been on the job for more than 18 months, and they are having a great impact. In addition, MinnPost just promoted office manager Bethany Hollenkamp to the new position of director of finance and operations, and recently welcomed our first development director, Claire Radomski, to fill out the executive team.&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p>With these successes in place, we as co-founders will continue to transition our staff roles to our new leadership during the course of the year. We are working on a detailed transition plan with our Board, which anticipates our continued commitment to serve as active members of the MinnPost board of directors and a few board committees.&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p>We are profoundly grateful for the opportunity to work with so many fantastic people: our staff, our Board, other volunteers, partners, and MinnPost’s many financial supporters and loyal readers. Our goal continues to be to provide high-quality journalism for people who care about Minnesota, and to create a sustainable business model for that journalism in a challenging time for media.&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p>We are proud of what MinnPost has accomplished, and what it has come to mean to Minnesotans. And we are optimistic that its future is bright, and that our leadership succession will be managed to leave MinnPost in good hands.&nbsp;</p>

      <h4>Journalism highlights</h4>
      
      <p class="byline">By <a href="https://www.minnpost.com/author/andrew-putz" target="_blank">Andrew Putz</a>, Executive Editor</p>
      
      <p>In an era when every piece of journalism — story, photo, post or tweet — can be assessed, evaluated and quantified, it’s easy to become transfixed by numbers: of views, of likes, of shares.&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p>That’s especially true when the numbers are good. And the numbers for MinnPost in 2015 were very, very good. Our page views, visits and users were all up, as was the amount of time people spent on the site. All in a year in which there were no major federal, state or local elections — coverage which is MinnPost’s bread and butter.&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p>More important than the figures, though, is how we got there, and what it says about our mission — and our audience. This year, many of our most-read stories were also our most ambitious: exhaustively reported pieces on issues critical to Minnesota. An in-depth look at the hiring practices at the University of Minnesota. An investigation into misconduct by a Minneapolis police unit. Several deep-dives on the political maneuvering behind a new professional soccer stadium. These stories often take weeks, and sometimes months, to produce, and their popularity is testament to both the community’s need — and readers’ hunger — for journalism that goes beyond the factoid of the moment or the meme of the week.&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p>Great journalism, of course, doesn’t happen without great journalists, and MinnPost has been blessed with an embarrassment of riches in that department. &nbsp;</p>

    </div>
    
    
    <div class="text-block large">
      
      <p>On state politics, for example, Briana Bierschbach continues to prove why she’s become such a trusted resource for Capitol-watchers. With stories this year on everything from the fractious and frenetic legislative session to the state’s abysmal public records policies, her coverage offered a way for Minnesotans to understand the often Byzantine ways of their state government. It’s little wonder that the Minnesota chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists named her the Young Journalist of the Year in 2015.</p>
      
      <p>Eric Black’s trenchant take on all things political continues to be a top draw to MinnPost, with observations that invariably reveal his dedication to fair-mindedness and an ability to place rapidly moving current events in a historical context. A quick example of his style, from a column describing a letter to the leadership of Iran from a group of United States senators: “[It] is obnoxious, unhelpful and unprecedented. It is accurate. It is insincere. It is unsubtle. It is partisan and political. It is irresponsible. It is constitutional. And, viewed through the correct satirical prism, it is humorous.”</p>

    </div>
    
    
    <div class="text-block large">
      
      <p>Covering local government, Peter Callaghan has established himself as one of the area’s most adroit reporters. This year, his reporting on the soccer stadium for a new MLS franchise — a saga that involved one team, two cities, myriad public officials and at least a couple of billionaires — became a must-read for anyone who wanted to know how things do (and don’t) get done in the Twin Cities.</p>

      
      <p>And our long-time education reporter Beth Hawkins delivered an epic and interactive project for readers: “Brothers’ Keepers,” which told the stories of six black men and boys whose lives intersect in ways that are both heartbreaking and hopeful. Or as Beth wrote: “We don’t hear a lot — and we don’t ask — about what it feels like to show up for school year after year unable to read.” Beth’s departure for a new job in October left big shoes to fill.&nbsp;</p>

    </div>
    
    <div class="text-block large">
      
      <p>When it comes to cultural coverage, Pamela Espeland’s Artscape column consistently offered smart, how-to-navigate advice on happenings throughout the Twin Cities. Her interviews this year with leading lights in the arts gave readers perspectives not seen elsewhere — as did her backstory on Minneapolis’ new Bob Dylan mural. Amy Goetzman, Andy Sturdevant and Jim Walsh likewise have earned enthusiastic followings for their sparkling arts coverage.</p>
      
      <p>Earth Journal writer Ron Meador won a first-place award for Best Independent News Blog on any subject from the Minnesota SPJ, and followed it up with can’t-miss pieces on unsustainable water use, a bat-killing plague and honeybee die-offs (just to name a few). Two days after he pointed to what he called ‘environmental vandalism’ in the Legislature's omnibus agriculture and environment bill, Gov. Mark Dayton vetoed the measure – despite the fact that it contained a buffer provision the governor had fought hard to get enacted.&nbsp;</p>

    <div class="text-block large">
      
      <p>In her coverage of mental health and addiction, Andy Steiner touched on topics from mental health workers’ low pay to Minnesota’s opioid addiction crisis, but we’re particularly proud of a piece she did on a St. Paul mother who struggled to understand her teenage daughter’s suicide. It’s one of the most emotionally powerful and deftly told stories you’ll read anywhere this year. In consumer health, Susan Perry has firmly established herself as an interpretive authority on health research in Second Opinion.</p>
      
      <p>In addition to being home to all these writers, MinnPost was lucky enough to bring on two other major talents this year. Sam Brodey joined MinnPost as our Washington correspondent, and soon made his mark with insightful stories on the Trans Pacific Partnership; the demise of No Child Left Behind; and consequences of the federal transportation bill on Minnesota. Andy Mannix joined us as a data/investigations reporter, a role in which he produced an important investigation into the brutal and constitutionally questionable tactics used by the Minneapolis Police Department’s Third Precinct Community Response Team.&nbsp;</p>

    <div class="text-block large">
      
      <p>Among important stories, those exploring the experience of immigrants and refugees in Minnesota are particularly critical, which is why we were grateful to be able to launch our New Americans beat this fall. Spearheaded by two talented journalists, Lorena Duarte and Ibrahim Hirsi, the beat has allowed us to explore issues that are often under-covered – about groups that are continuing to change and refine what it means to be a Minnesotan. And in Rural Dispatches, Gregg Aamot regularly spotlighted key Greater Minnesota problems and solutions.</p>
      
      <p>Finally, a word about a few people who are instrumental to MinnPost’s success but who seldom get the credit they deserve. Managing Editor Susan Albright oversees our Community Voices section as well as our coverage of the arts, education, health and the environment, doing so with a level of smarts, grace and generosity that borders on the miraculous. News Editor Tom Nehil — who edits our Washington coverage, serves as our data czar and oversees comment moderation — makes everything he touches smarter and better, which might be annoying if it weren’t so critical. Web Editor Corey Anderson oversees design and production of the site, a job description that tends to underestimate his importance to MinnPost’s culture and day-to-day functioning by a factor of several thousand.&nbsp;</p>

      <h4>Financial report</h4>
      
      <p class="byline">by <a href="http://www.minnpost.com/author/andrew-wallmeyer" target="_blank">Andrew Wallmeyer</a>, Publisher</p>
      
      <p>Financially, MinnPost is healthier than it has ever been. In recent years, we have made strategic investments to lay the groundwork for future revenue growth and enable MinnPost co-founders Joel and Laurie Kramer to reduce their involvement in our day-to-day operations. We started reaping the benefits of those investments in 2015, with strong growth in membership and event revenue offsetting expected declines in foundation support and capital campaign donations. At the same time, we made a few personnel moves that give us a business leadership team we believe will keep MinnPost growing for years to come.</p>
      
      <p>MinnPost recorded revenues of $1.87 million in 2015, down 5% from 2014. This total includes $742,000 in membership donations and events, $442,000 in sponsorship and advertising, $602,000 in foundation grants, $83,000 in growth-capital campaign donations, and $5,000 in other revenue.</p>
      
      <p>[CHART REVENUE 2014 vs 2015??]</p>
      
      <p>The slight decline in total revenue stems primarily from significant but anticipated decreases in foundation and capital campaign revenue. Foundation grants were down 17% from an abnormally high 2014 amount, while capital campaign revenue fell 51% as we entered the final stage of that multi-year fundraising effort.</p>
      
      <p>The investments we made in our membership program over the past two years — with support from the Knight Foundation — are starting to bear fruit. Membership donations and event revenue were up 14% from 2014, with the strongest growth coming from member-donors who give less than $1,000. We finished 2015 with 2,616 member households, up 16% from last year.</p>
      
      <p>Advertising and sponsorship revenue saw modest growth of 3% in what continues to be a challenging and competitive market.&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p>Expenses for 2015 were $1.80 million, up 8% from 2014, due primarily to increased staff costs. The surplus for 2015 was $66,154, compared to a 2014 surplus of $298,116. (The 2014 surplus was partly a matter of timing: we received the first $300,000 payment on our membership-building grant from Knight Foundation that year, but didn’t spend much of it until 2015.) This is MinnPost’s sixth consecutive annual surplus. Cash on hand at year-end was $751,000, our strongest position since shortly after we launched in 2007.</p>
      
      <p>Our cash reserves amount to more than four months of operating expenses, giving us a welcome financial cushion that puts us in good shape heading into the final phase of our leadership transition plan, which involves running manageable deficits in 2016 and 2017 as we increase operating revenue to the point where it fully supports the new staff positions we have added in recent years.</p>
      
      <p>A handful of personnel changes made in 2015 have significantly changed the face and structure of our business staff.</p>
      
      <p>In August, we said farewell to Membership &amp; Events Coordinator Ashleigh Swenson, who after three years with MinnPost took another job that gives her more time to be with her young daughters.</p>
      
      <p>In December, we hired Claire Radomski to be MinnPost’s Development Director, a new position that oversees our individual and institutional giving efforts, including membership, major gifts, and foundation grants. Claire comes to us from WFYI, a public radio and television broadcaster in Indianapolis, where she was director of membership. Her addition will enable Laurie and Joel Kramer to further reduce the amount of time they currently spend soliciting major gifts and foundation grants.</p>
      
      <p>And on Jan. 1 we promoted Bethany Hollenkamp from Office Manager to Director of Operations and Finance. Bethany has been with MinnPost since 2013, and will soon receive her MBA from the University of Minnesota’s Carlson School of Management. Her promotion completes a yearlong process in which she gradually assumed responsibility for MinnPost’s day-to-day finances and administration from retiring Business Manager Bryan Powell, who ably managed our finances and administration since MinnPost launched in 2007.</p>
      
      <p>Along with longtime Advertising Director Sally Waterman, Bethany and Claire report to me. Collectively, the four of us make up the MinnPost business leadership team.</p>
